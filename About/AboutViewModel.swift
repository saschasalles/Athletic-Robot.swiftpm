Hello, I'm Sascha Salles üëã\n
I am a French student based in Bordeaux üç∑.
I'm 22 years old and I'm pursuing a master in computer engineering.

I'm passionate about iOS development. I'm fortunate to be able to volunteer to teach Swift to students at my school every Wednesday for 8 hours.
In parallel I'm an apprentice (intern) in a mobile application startup and I learn a little bit more every day about the iOS development world.

My dream would be to work with you, in this wonderful company, and to take up hard and inspiring challenges.
That's why I decided to take the student challenge this year too.
Last year this experience changed my life in the most beautiful way, I can't thank you enough for allowing me to meet Tim Cook üòá.
Obviously the desire to do the Swift Student Challenge again was very intense.

So what about Atletic Robot ?

"""
The initials of Athletic Robot are a nod to augmented reality.
A subject I am very passionate about and with an incredible potential.
In the world of sports, we can quickly be embarrassed by the look of others, the idea of a virtual coach (Tim Coach) in AR came to me directly.
Today we are all very connected and it's crucial to take some time for your health and well-being.
This is the message I wanted to pass.
I hope you will enjoy this little app, in any case it was a real pleasure to participate in the challenge.
